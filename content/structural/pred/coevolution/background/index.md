# Background on Protein Structure and Evolution

    A. Overview of protein folding and the sequence-structure relationship
       1. Protein structure hierarchy: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure
       2. Thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of protein folding
       3. Experimental methods to study protein folding: spectroscopy, calorimetry, and single-molecule techniques
    B. Sequence determinants of protein structure
       1. Role of amino acid properties: size, charge, hydrophobicity, and polarity
       2. Secondary structure propensities of amino acids
       3. Local and global interactions stabilizing protein structure
    C. Evolutionary constraints on protein sequences
       1. Selective pressures for maintaining structure and function
       2. Mutation, selection, and drift in protein evolution
       3. Sequence conservation and variability across homologs
    D. Structural and functional diversity of protein families
       1. Evolutionary divergence and convergence of protein structures
       2. Relationship between sequence, structure, and function within protein families
       3. Examples of protein families with conserved structures and diverse functions
