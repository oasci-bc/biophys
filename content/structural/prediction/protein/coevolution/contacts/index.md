# From Coevolution to Contacts
    A. Interpreting coevolutionary scores
       1. Relationship between coevolution and spatial proximity
       2. Distinguishing structural and functional couplings
       3. Identifying long-range and interchain contacts
    B. Contact definition and distance thresholds
       1. Atom-based and residue-based definitions
       2. Distance cutoffs for defining contacts: 8Å, 10Å, and others
       3. Considerations for different protein classes and folds
    C. Sequence separation and contact probability
       1. Local contacts: within 6-12 residues in sequence
       2. Medium-range contacts: between secondary structure elements
       3. Long-range contacts: between distant regions in sequence
    D. Typical performance of contact prediction methods
       1. Precision and coverage of top-ranked contacts
       2. Comparison across different protein families and alignment depths
       3. Challenges and opportunities for improvement
