# Coevolution and Correlated Mutations

    A. Concept of coevolution in proteins
       1. Definition and theoretical basis
       2. Types of coevolution: pairwise, higher-order, and intramolecular
    B. Mechanisms of coevolution
       3. Structural constraints: maintaining contacts and interactions
       4. Functional constraints: preserving active sites and specificity
       5. Thermodynamic and kinetic constraints: ensuring stability and folding
    C. Correlated mutations as a signature of coevolution
       6. Definition and early observations
       7. Relationship to structural and functional constraints
       8. Examples of correlated mutations in protein families
    D. Challenges in detecting coevolution
       9. Distinguishing direct and indirect couplings
       10. Accounting for phylogenetic relationships and background conservation
       11. Dealing with statistical noise and limited data
