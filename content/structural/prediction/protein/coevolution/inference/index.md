# Inference of Coevolutionary Couplings

A. Inputs for coevolutionary inference
    1. Multiple sequence alignments: construction and quality control
    2. Sequence weighting and resampling strategies
    3. Incorporating structural and functional information
B. Covariation measures and scoring functions
    1. Local methods: mutual information, statistical coupling, and perturbation-based scores
    2. Global methods: maximum entropy, Bayesian networks, and machine learning
    3. Advantages and limitations of different approaches
C. Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) and related methods
    1. Theoretical foundations and mathematical formulation
    2. Mean-field approximation and pseudolikelihood maximization
    3. Gauge fixing and regularization techniques
    4. Sparse variants and computational optimizations
D. Other key coevolution prediction methods
    1. Protein Sparse Inverse COVariance (PSICOV)
    2. Generative REgularized ModeLs of proteINs (GREMLIN)
    3. Coevolution-based Contact Prediction (CCMPred)
    4. Sparse inverse covariance estimation (SLICE) and graphical LASSO
E. Performance evaluation and benchmarking
    1. Gold standard datasets: manually curated and structurally derived contacts
    2. Metrics: precision, recall, AUC, and rank-based scores
    3. Cross-validation and statistical significance assessment
