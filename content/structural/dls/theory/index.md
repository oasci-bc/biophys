# Theoretical Background

**Brownian Motion and Diffusion Coefficients:**
- Brownian motion is the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, resulting from collisions with the molecules of the fluid. This phenomenon was first observed by Robert Brown in 1827.
- The diffusion coefficient (D) quantifies the rate at which particles move through the solvent. For spherical particles, the diffusion coefficient is related to the particle size and the viscosity of the solvent.

**Light Scattering Theory:**
- When a laser beam illuminates a sample, particles scatter the light in all directions. The scattered light's intensity and angle depend on the particle size and shape.
- The scattered light's intensity fluctuates over time due to the Brownian motion of the particles, and these fluctuations can be analyzed to determine particle size.

**Autocorrelation Function:**
- The autocorrelation function describes the correlation between the intensity of scattered light at different times. It decays as the time difference increases, with the rate of decay providing information about the particle's diffusion coefficient.
- For monodisperse particles, the autocorrelation function is a single exponential decay. For polydisperse particles, it is a sum of exponentials.

**Stokes-Einstein Equation:**
- The Stokes-Einstein equation relates the diffusion coefficient to the hydrodynamic diameter (D_H) of the particles:
  \[ D_H = \frac{kT}{3\pi\eta D} \]
  where \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, \( T \) is the absolute temperature, \( \eta \) is the viscosity of the solvent, and \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient.
