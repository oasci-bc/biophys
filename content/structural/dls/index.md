# Dynamic light scattering

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) is a powerful analytical technique used to determine the size distribution of small particles in suspension or polymers in solution. It measures the time-dependent fluctuations in the intensity of scattered light due to the Brownian motion of particles. These fluctuations provide information about the particle size through the calculation of the diffusion coefficient.
