# Experimental procedures

**Sample Preparation:**
- Use high-purity solvents and buffers to minimize contamination.
- Filter samples using 0.22 Âµm or smaller filters to remove dust and aggregates.
- Degas samples to remove air bubbles that can interfere with light scattering measurements.

**Instrument Calibration:**
- Calibrate the DLS instrument using standard particles of known size (e.g., polystyrene latex beads) to ensure accurate measurements.
- Perform calibration regularly to account for any drifts or changes in instrument performance.

**Measurement Protocols:**
- Maintain a consistent temperature using a temperature-controlled sample holder or water bath.
- Measure samples at different concentrations to ensure reliable data, avoiding concentrations too high to prevent multiple scattering effects.
- Perform multiple repetitions to obtain average values and assess measurement repeatability.

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
- Addressing problems like multiple scattering (reduce sample concentration), dust contamination (filter samples), and sample instability (ensure proper dispersion and no aggregation).
