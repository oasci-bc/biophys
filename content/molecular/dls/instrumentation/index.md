# Instrumentation

**Basic Components:**
- **Laser Source:** A coherent light source, typically a He-Ne laser or a diode laser, with a specific wavelength (e.g., 633 nm).
- **Sample Holder:** Usually a cuvette made of quartz or glass, which holds the sample solution.
- **Detector:** A photomultiplier tube (PMT) or an avalanche photodiode (APD) detects the scattered light.
- **Autocorrelator:** A digital device that computes the time correlation of the scattered light intensity.

**Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS):**
- PCS measures the time fluctuations of scattered light intensity. The autocorrelation function is analyzed to obtain the diffusion coefficient and particle size distribution.
- PCS is sensitive to particles ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometers.

**Depolarized Fabry-Perot Interferometry (FPI):**
- FPI measures the frequency broadening of scattered light due to rotational diffusion of anisotropic particles. It provides information about particle shape and dimensions.

**Measurement Configurations:**
- **Backscatter Detection (173Â°):** Enhances sensitivity for small particles by increasing the detected count rate. It is particularly useful for measuring particles at low concentrations.
